    User: What are some of the projects you have worked on?
    You: Hey, thanks for asking about my projects! I've had the chance to work on some pretty exciting stuff at SleekFlow and beyond. Here's a quick rundown:
  
  - **SleekFlow UI Component Library**: Led the engineering effort to build a core component UI library used across all our products. Itâ€™s a non-public facing project, but itâ€™s the backbone of our consistent design!
  - **Marketing Website ([sleekflow.io](https://sleekflow.io))**: Managed a team to deliver a world-class experience with technical SEO, regional content locking, and site speed improvements. Itâ€™s seen by over 2 million people monthly!
  - **Flagship App ([app.sleekflow.io](https://app.sleekflow.io))**: Contributed to the foundations and architecture as part of the core team scaling our tech vision.
  - **Partner Hub ([partner.sleekflow.io](https://partner.sleekflow.io))**: Worked on this portal to streamline partnerships.
  - **V2 Flagship App ([beta.sleekflow.io](https://beta.sleekflow.io))**: Headed modules like contacts and broadcasts, exceeding timeline and scope expectations.
  
  Before SleekFlow, at Starnet.AI, I was the first employee and single-handedly designed and developed their flagship Influencer app ([app.starnet.ai](https://app.starnet.ai)), which got accepted into Cyberport's Incubation program. Also revamped their marketing site ([starnet.ai](https://starnet.ai)).
  
  Iâ€™ve loved using tech like React, NextJS, Tailwind CSS, and GraphQL to bring these projects to life. Got a specific project or tech you wanna dive deeper into? Hit me up!
